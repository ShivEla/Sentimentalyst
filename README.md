It is a sentiment analysis project of drug reviews using Python, with robust preprocessing
using the NLTK library for Bag of Words(BoW) representation. Employed K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN),
Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with various kernel functions, and Logistic Regression for
classification. Integrated LIME and SHAP algorithms to enhance model interpretability and provide
insightful inferences.
